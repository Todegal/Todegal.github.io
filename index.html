			<h3 class="tutorial-title">OpenGL Tutorials</h3>
			<p class="tutorial-desc">
				Opengl is a very powerful graphics API which has powered games and computer graphics engines for decades.
				<br/><br/>
				In these tutorials we will start with the basics of OpenGL - rendering using GLUT and the fixed-functionally
				pipeline. But in later tutorials we will cover more advanced topics and develop an abstraction which will make it easier
				for us to develop advanced shading.

			<h3 class="tutorial-title">Source Engine Tutorials</h3>
			<p class="tutorial-desc">
				The source engine, Valve's in-house proprietary engine was used to develop many of the greatest games of the last
				generation. While it might seem old-fashioned compared to Unity and Unreal - the graphical behemoths of our age -
				its powerful archetecture is still great to learn from an academic perspective. Also with modern games like Titanfall 2
				pushing the engine to its limits I think it is safe to say the Source engine is as relevant now as ever.
				<br/><br/>
				In these tutorials I will teach you how to setup and run a Source mod. How to create custom assets and entities. We
				 will cover AI/NPC creation and UI in later tutorials.
